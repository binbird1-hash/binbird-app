# BinBird App Starter (Next.js + Supabase)

## Quick Start
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase values.
2. Install: `npm install`
3. Run: `npm run dev`
4. Deploy on Vercel and set the two env vars in the dashboard.

After deploy:
- Visit `/auth` and sign up.
- In Supabase SQL Editor, make your user admin:
  ```sql
  update user_profile set role='admin'
  where user_id = (select id from auth.users where email='YOUR_EMAIL');
  ```
- Create client/property/schedule (via DB for now), go to `/ops/generate`, then `/staff/today` to test uploads.

## Troubleshooting admin sign-in

If an account with the `admin` role stays stuck on the login screen, walk through these checks:

1. **Confirm the profile row exists** – In the Supabase table editor run:
   ```sql
   select user_id, role
   from user_profile
   where user_id = (select id from auth.users where email = 'YOUR_EMAIL');
   ```
   If no row is returned, insert one:
   ```sql
   insert into user_profile (user_id, role)
   values ((select id from auth.users where email = 'YOUR_EMAIL'), 'admin')
   on conflict (user_id) do update set role = excluded.role;
   ```
2. **Make sure the role is spelled `admin`** – Any other value (including uppercase or extra spaces) will be treated as missing and the middleware will redirect back to `/auth/login`.
3. **Verify the `get_my_role` function** – In Supabase SQL editor the RPC should read the `user_id` column:
   ```sql
   create or replace function get_my_role()
   returns text
   language sql
   security definer
   set search_path = public
   as $$
     select role
     from user_profile
     where user_id = auth.uid();
   $$;
   ```
   After saving the function, sign out and back in. The middleware relies on this RPC to resolve your admin session before redirecting you to `/admin`.
